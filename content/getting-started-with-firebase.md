# what is firebase 
## overview
The article examines the peculiarities of the influence of e-government as a tool of transparent measures on the effectiveness of public administration. The peculiarities of the mechanism of interaction between E-governance of public administration in the context of the implementation of the informatization policy are investigated, taking into account the complexity and inconsistency of the nature of this process. A system of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of public management in the context of the introduction of e-government is proposed. The decisive role of innovation at the current stage of society's development contributes to increasing the requirements for quality standards of public administration. In modern conditions, traditional hierarchical, bureaucratic organizational structures of the state are no longer able to flexibly and effectively carry out management processes. The complication of the control system with the complication of the controlled system is natural. But the main problem is how to achieve this correspondence in terms of complexity. The expansion of the "layers" of the management pyramid stimulates the process of strengthening the centralization of the bureaucratic organization, the formation of relatedly duplicated subsystems that control the correctness of the generation and transmission of management signals, as well as increase the degree of coherence of the organizational structure, which tends to "loosen."
